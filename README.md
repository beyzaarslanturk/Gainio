#### A simple project that  was I found on the internet months ago (no looking any code!) , this project was completed using HTML , CSS and my purpose in making this project was to experience basic HTML CSS features .  <br>  <br>  <br>

My achievements were:
- Creating main layout
- Flexbox
- Positions
- Creating navbar and main HTML attributes
- Animations
- Responsive Desing ( There are some problems with media queries because of it was one of the project between my first projects)
